### INFO
This is game inspired by the ongoing research within the interdisciplinary GEHIR project at Masaryk University in Brno (http://gehir.phil.muni.cz/). The project systematically applies selected methods of formalized modelling and computational simulations to the study of the diffusion dynamics of specific religious ideas and forms of behavior. One of the case studies within the project analyzes the spread of the Egyptian cults during the Hellenistic period. This particular topic is also the theme of the game.

The spatial distribution of the archaeological evidence shows the outcome of the spread of the Egyptian cults and the epicentre (Egypt, namely the main port - Alexandria). However, academic discussion is not sure about mechanics involved in the process of the spread of these cults. GEHIR researchers are thus focusing on uncovering those key factors influencing the successful spread of Egyptian cults during the Hellenistic period - and so is the player of the game.

### GOALS
At first, the player is asked to choose between four Egyptian cults (named by the important Egyptian deities: Serapis, Isis, Anubis, Bastet). The main goal is to spread the selected cult successfully across the ancient Mediterranean. In other words, the player strives to gain more worshippers than your opponents driven by AI.

### MECHANICS
The main hypotheses in the actual research are that the spread of the Egyptian cults during the Hellenistic period was so successful because of:

a) the maritime trade (*supporting evidence: Egypt was one of the main exporters of grain and Egyptian sailors carried the cults on their travels*)

b) political propaganda (*supporting evidence: Egyptian cults were closely tied to the ruling Ptolemaic dynasty and Ptolemies were politically active across the whole ancient Mediterranean*)

The player thus operates mainly as a coordinator of the maritime trade and pays attention to politics. Ships loaded with grain sail across the maritime transportation network and unload parts of the cargo in ports on their way to final destinations. As a side effect, each ship can spread the selected cult while it is anchored in a port. Therefore, by upgrading ships, strategically selected ports or political choices the player can gain various advantages in the process of the spread of the cult. The opponents have the same choices. Key features of the game are explained below in the __Manual__.

### MANUAL

#### OVERVIEW
The UI offers a basic overview of the game:
* __Center__: The main environment of the game with the transportation network
* __Top right__: Game time differed into weeks and seasons; gold earned from trade
* __Bottom center and left__: Game menu and statistics
* __Bottom right__: Miniature map and play/pause/fast forward options

#### ISLANDS
Islands in the game are individual units with specific grain production based on environmental analysis, population and accessible ports. Based on the ratio between the grain production and the population size the island is either self-sufficient or suffers from food shortages which can lead to dying population. In order to survive, islands with hunger issues attract travelling merchant ships with grain. Approaching ships can unload part of their cargo in exchange for gold and subsequently spread the cults (a type of the cult depends on who is the owner of the ship).

The player can upgrade various facilities on an island for gaining advantages:
* __Hospital__: Reduces the number of deaths while the island suffers from hunger and increases the natural growth of the population size
*  __Granary__: Increases production effectivity of island and therefore, reduces the risk of hunger. Also, the island with Granary could not have infestation event
*  __Amphitheater__: Increases the prestige of an island which leads to higher trade attractivity. could result in festival event
*  __Port__: Offers better price for traded goods

#### EVENTS
*  *__Event__: An infestation can occur and when it does, it reduces the grain production significantly in the infested area*
* *__Event__: A war can occur which leads to blockade of ports in the war area*
* *__Event__: Sometimes there are games and festivals held on various islands. These islands gain trade prestige (higher trade attractivity and better prices) for a short period of time*

#### SHIPS
At first, the player releases the ship from Alexandria or Leuke-Akte in Egypt. The ship then automatically chooses its final destination (one of the main continental ports) based on the balance of politics. The player has three ships to begin with. The player can upgrade the ships or buy more of them (in exchange for gold). The ship has upgradable speed, capacity, and energy. Energy of the ship consists of morale and supplies for the crew. Energy runs out with distance and the ships stop in ports to refill the energy (and unload cargo if it is demanded by the port/island and can spread cults).

#### POLITICS
At the beginning of each season, the player votes for the preferred continetal port. If a port has many preferential points or significant (randomly attributed) political power, the ship automatically chooses that port as its final destination.


#### WEATHER AND TIME
The weather has a crucial impact on the grain production and travelling. The production depends heavily on the amount of rainfall and temperature. There are observable rains in the game which are carried across the environment by winds. The air temperature varies depending on geographical location and season. The weather also influences the speed of ships. They are slower during winter and rains. The game time starts in the year 400 BCE because the early spread of the Egyptian cults started in the 4th century BCE.

#### CULTS
Player can choose between ancient Egyptian cults connected to important Egyptian deities:

*  __Isis__: She was one of the most important deities in ancient Egypt. She was the mother of the god Horus and her husband was Osiris. During the Hellenistic period, she also became the wife of the god Serapis. Isis was a universal goddess and a patron deity of sailors.

	*__Advantage__: Ships do not suffer from the rain penalty*

* __Serapis__: He has roots in the ancient royal cult of the god Osiris-Apis. Together with Isis, he became the patron god of the Ptolemaic dynasty ruling during the Hellenistic period. He is also a universal deity.

	*__Advantage__: Each point spent in voting has twice the impact*

	![Serapis](http://www.colorado.edu/classics/clas1061/Graphics/Serapis.jpg)

* __Bastet__: She was the famous lion goddess of Egypt. She is known for her temper and protective behaviour. She was also the patron deity of hunters and mothers.

	*__Advantage__: Ships also make trade with islands in war and her cult easily spreads from one generation to another*

	![Bastet](http://www.thefakebusters.com/statues/photos%20statues/real%20statue%2014c.jpg)

* __Anubis__: He is known as the god with a jackal head. He weighed the hearts of dead people in the final judgement. He was a patron deity of funeral rites and protected people in their afterlife.

	*__Advantage__: The ships' operation cost is significantly reduced*
